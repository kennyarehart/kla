						The Old Schoolhouse is an event space located at the heart of the Willamette Valley wine region
						in Newberg, Oregon. Built in 1928 and filled with unbelievable views of hills and orchards. Only
						a 45-minute drive from downtown Portland, it is well located, minutes away from some of our
						favourite and the most famous wineries.
